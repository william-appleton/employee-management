# employee-management

This app allows users to view and interact with employee information stored on a MySQL databse. It utilizes inquirer to run a node.js app that prompts the user when the index.js file is run. Current functionality includes viewing all employees, company departments, and roles, as well as the ability to create new employee, department, and roll records. Employee roles can also be updated. In future developments more functionality will be added to allow users to update all aspects of an employee's record, as well as be able to delete information from the database.
